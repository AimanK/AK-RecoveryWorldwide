# AK-RecoveryWorldwide

- Built using vanilla CSS3 and HTML5.
- I made sure to keep best practices in mind and hope that the way I organized my code is satisfactory.
- Site is responsive for smartphones (please feel free to load the site on your phone!), and should be responsive for tablets as well.
- Made use of flex-box for the layout of the entire project.

I hope you enjoyed this project and noticed my attempts to impress you with a bit of extra UI/UX prettiness!
